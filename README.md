# TL-D3 BUILD

This project will be coverting a stock Tenlong TL-D3 IDEX 3D printer into a fully upgraded machine running on Klipper Firmware.<br>
The information collected in the GitHub is compiled from many different locations on the internet.<br>
The intent will be to build here as complete of a collection of files, data and resources that are required to complete this project.<br>
<br><br><br>
<b>Hardware used for this build.</b><br>
<br>
<b>MCU =</b> BTT Octopus Pro V1.1<br>
<b>CPU =</b> Raspberry Pi 4b with 8GB ram & 64GB Sandisk Extreme Pro MicroSD Card<br>
<b>Base =</b> TenLog TLD3 Pro<br>
<b>Display =</b> TFT35 HDMI 3.5" touch screen<br>
<b>Power =</b> 24V<br>
<br><br><br>
This will include the following upgrades.<br>
<br>
1- BTT Octopus Pro V1.1 MCU to replace the stock MCU.<br>
2- Installing 2209 v1.2 Stepper drivers onto the new MCU.<br>
3- installing a Raspberry Pi 4b (8GB) with a 64GB Sandisk Extream SD Card.<br>
4- Installing a 3.5" color touch screen to replace the stock screen.<br>
5- Installing KlipperOS and Mainsail, KlipperScreen.<br>
6- Configuring the Printer in Klipper.<br>
7- Testing and completion.<br>

<b>Notes</b><br>
<br>
See the cura profiles folder for all the cura profiles needed for the TL-D3 Pro. Very useful for getting cura setup. Works with Cura 5.9.0<br>
The STL's posted here are very useful for making your TL-D3 Pro more compatible of doing better cleaner prints. Plus a few extra STL files that will be good add-ons to the final build as well.<br>
