My Build of a Tenlong TL-D3 IDEX Printer with BTT Octopus Pro 1.1 MCU &amp; Raspberry Pi 4b (8GB)

My Build of a Tenlong TL-D3 IDEX Printer with BTT Octopus Pro 1.1 with Klipper
Will be coverting a stock Tenlong TL-D3 IDEX 3D printer into an updated better running machine using Klipper Firmware.
<br><br><br>
This will include the following upgrades.
<br><br>


1- BTT Octopus Pro V1.1 MCU to replace the stock MCU.
<br>
2- Installing 2209 v1.2 Stepper drivers onto the new MCU.
<br>
3- installing a Raspberry Pi 4b (8GB) with a 64GB Sandisk Extream SD Card.
<br>
4- Installing a 3.5" color touch screen to replace the stock screen.
<br>
5- Installing KlipperOS and Mainsail, KlipperScreen.
<br>
6- Configuring the Printer in Klipper.
<br>
7- Testing and completion.
<br><br>


This will be a good collection of Files, Data and resources required to build this project.<br>
Everything should be in one place and easy to access when needed.
