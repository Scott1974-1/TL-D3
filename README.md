# TL-D3 BUILD

This project will be coverting a stock Tenlong TL-D3 IDEX 3D printer into a fully upgraded machine running on Klipper Firmware.<br>
The information collected in the GitHub is compiled from many different locations on the internet.<br>
The intent will be to build here as complete of a collection of files, data and resources that are required to complete this project.<br>
<br><br><br>
### Hardware used for this build.<br>
<br>
MCU = BTT Octopus Pro v1.1<br>
Steppers = 2209 v1.2
CPU = Raspberry Pi 4b with 8GB ram & 64GB Sandisk Extreme Pro MicroSD Card<br>
Chassis = TenLog TLD3 Pro<br>
Display = TFT35 HDMI 3.5" touch screen<br>
Power = 24V<br>
<br><br><br>
### This will include the following upgrades.<br>
<br>
1- BTT Octopus Pro v1.1 MCU to replace the stock MCU.<br>
2- Installing 2209 v1.2 Stepper drivers onto the new MCU.<br>
3- installing a Raspberry Pi 4b as a main CPU running MainsailOS<br>
4- Installing a 3.5" color touch screen to replace the stock screen.<br>
5- Configuring the Printer in Klipper.<br>
6- Testing and completion.<br>

### Notes<br>
<br>
See the cura profiles folder for all the cura profiles needed for the TL-D3 Pro. Very useful for getting cura setup. Works with Cura 5.9.0<br>
The STL's posted here are very useful for making your TL-D3 Pro more compatible of doing better cleaner prints. Plus a few extra STL files that will be good add-ons to the final build as well.<br>
